### Online Relationship
Just as Gene McHugh mentioned in *The Context of the Digital: A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships*, *"the internet has become even more dominant as a tool to meet others"*, people nowadays are creating more online relationships with others than ever. People live and communicate on the Internet, meet new people, interact with them, and build either deep or shallow relationships with others. For some people, their online and offline identities are the same identity, only existing in different spaces. When online, they are engaging with others with the same genuineness and in a more comfortable, freer, uninhibited way. I believe that the establishment of intimacy does not necessarily require the intervention of physical contact. Although two people who meet online can only know each other through texts, pictures/videos, and voices from digital devices, they are connected spiritually. The emotional feelings they give to each other are also authentic.

(unfinished yet!)

Found this project really interested and related to the topic of online intimacy:
