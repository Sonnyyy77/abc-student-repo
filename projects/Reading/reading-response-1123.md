### Online Relationship
Just as Gene McHugh mentioned in *The Context of the Digital: A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships*, *"the internet has become even more dominant as a tool to meet others"*, people nowadays are creating more online relationships with others than ever. People live and communicate on the Internet, meet new people, interact with them, and build either deep or shallow relationships with others. For some people, their online and offline identities are the same identity, only existing in different spaces. When online, they are engaging with others with the same genuineness and in a more comfortable, freer, uninhibited way. I believe that the establishment of intimacy does not necessarily require the intervention of physical contact. Although two people who meet online can only know each other through texts, pictures/videos, and voices from digital devices, they are connected spiritually. The emotional feelings they give to each other are also authentic.

Claire L. Evans' *In the Name of Love* presents the disengagement and deletion of a relationship both in reality and on the internet after the end of a relationship. Although a relationship has ended in real life, the traces they once left on the Internet remain, and will even constantly remind people of the relationship. Nowadays, ending a relationship can't be as simple as destroying souvenirs or messages/love letters, people need to completely delete the traces of the relationship from every corner of the internet, yet this is not easy. One may even "peek" at the other through social media, thus making the end of the relationship even longer and more painful. *"In your attempts to clear the debris, you discover that, like an ecosystem, your social network reacts holistically to change."* Similar to the first article, what this article conveys is that online virtual space is a place where you can store and create a relationship. Meanwhile, the relationships online are harder to erase compared with the offline relationships.

Found this project really interested and related to the topic of online intimacy:
