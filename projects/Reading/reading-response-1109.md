### The Different **WORLDS** of Cao Fei
In this RMB City, I observed a very fascinating combination of reality and virtuality. By placing iconic buildings from real-world Chinese cities in virtual space, artist Cao Fei not only gives people a tangible sense of China's rapid development, but also allows them to reflect on the impact behind that development. She boldly places these buildings in relatively uncanny positions that seem bizarre and dangerous yet feel connotative. Through such absurd combinations she shows the influence of capitalism in Chinese society and how communism and socialism cross over in this development. The avatars in the RMB city are equally thought-provoking. She mentioned a viewpoint from Christine Liao that *"the body images that users create for their avatars 'usually do not mirror their physical body but are accumulations of imagination and desires. . . . Because avatars carry information about personal desires and cultural experiences, avatars do not represent the dream of cyberspace as a space without stereotype of human and discrimination'"*. Just like the avatar that Cao Fei had love affair with, the young blond Chinese, he is not a Chinese at all, a sixty- five year old American in real life, which confirms Cao Fei's view that *"When you’re online in a totally new world, your physical self is more invisible, and it’s your inner self that’s revealed"*.

### Now You're **IN** My Computer by Eva and Franco Mattes
For the project called *Life Sharing*, those two artists put all the information on their computers openly and honestly on the Internet for others to see. By sharing their information with others, they conveyed their view that "PRIVACY IS STUPID". They turned the project into a virtual exhibition, displaying their lives and work for people to view at their leisure. By providing information about themselves, they create a relatively three-dimensional and realistic identity on the Internet. Without changing its content, they allowed people to "download, remix, and reuse". However, they use pseudonyms while disclosing their information, which is contradictory to their concept. They shaped a real yet fake identity. With the emergence of the new social media sites like "My Space", people's virtual presence online has changed. Unlike the previous simple observation in which people cannot change the content displayed, social media now allows people to agree with others to change their virtual identities by giving comments and different opinions.
