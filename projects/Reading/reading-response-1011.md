I think the statement "context is king" is appealing to us, when looking at a work of art, especially net art, to analyze it based on its context and the context of its time/technology. From the examples given in the article, *The Web Stalker* and *Automatic Rain* were both designed and created based on the background of internet technology at that time, because they used the imperfection of internet technology at that time as the main expression of the works. It is very clear that context is quite essential for these two projects, when it was before the Internet's "corporate turn". As for the time after the Internet's “corporate turn”, the statement "context is king" also applied, only in a new form. In this era, the "context" became "adopting the aesthetics, function, or persona of a corporation", rather than the Internet itself. Artworks pay more attention to the aesthetics of catering to business, using commercial as the cornerstone to create all projects.

The strategy of creating “work that contains a relatively strong political and social intent, but is clothed […] in ironic ambiguity” is well aligned with the *Black Net.Art Actions* by Mendi + Keith Obadike. There are three works in the series: *Blackness for Sale*, *The Interaction of Colored*, and *Keeping Up Appearances*. In different forms, these three works allow people to rethink the race of color under internet art, leading them to contemplate what blackness of black people would look like if it were auctioned off on the internet, how different colors of people are treated distinctly on the internet, and the striking contrast between how blacks and whites are represented in the daily social life. They all contain a strong political and social intent by addressing the topic of race, but somehow in a very sarcastic way.
