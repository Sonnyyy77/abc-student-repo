When I first saw the images, icons and GIFs that Lialina displayed on the page, I feel like I'm getting nostalgic, like I'm back in the old days. Looking back at the visual expressions of the past from nowadays, we can clearly and directly perceive the continuous change of people's aesthetic perceptions. And throughout the comparison between the Vernacular Web and the current web Lialina provided in terms of links, MIDI, frames, etc., she made me realize that the Vernacular Web is a very subjective and amateurish page. In her words, "it was the web of the indigenous...or the barbarians". But it is also very personal, and the elements used in the web page represent individual preferences, making it feel more vivid and lifelike, unlike the common web pages nowadays. This is why when we look at the Vernacular Web, we can visually and tangibly feel the changes that the times have brought to us, not only aesthetically, but also in terms of expression.

The elements that people have used in the past on Vernacular Web are not really that bad, in my opinion. They were actually very straightforward in expressing the message that the owner of the website wanted to convey. While they can look clumsy and funny, they should never be "a subject of mockery".
