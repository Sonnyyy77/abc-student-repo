The "persona", or the virtual body, that we create on the Internet to some extent matches some of our real-life characteristics. Maybe this body is very different from our real situation, but we are still using this body to socialize with others on the Internet. So this virtual body can actually be seen as another identity/personality of ours. As a result, it is impossible to completely separate the virtual body from the physical one, which is why when our virtual body on the internet is hurt/betrayed by others, we can really feel hurt/betrayed too.

The virtual or intangible content/projects we utilize or produce on the Internet more or less represent some of our personal preferences or inclinations, some of which we have even invested a lot of time, experience and emotion in. This can lead us to consider the content we create on the Internet as part of ourselves. It reminds me of when we do some disembodied projects, if we have to make big changes or even redo them all, we feel heartbroken not only because we spent a lot of time on it, but also because it represents a part of us. And deleting or changing them is comparable to deleting or changing a part of ourselves.
