## Friends or Enemies?

When referring to parasites, some people may instinctively assume that they are only bad for their hosts and try to eliminate them. But in fact, some parasites can live in symbiosis with their hosts. So I come up with the idea of letting the characteristics of parasites change according to the way we treat them. The user can decide whether to become friends or enemies with them.

This parasite feeds on the letters on the page. When you open any website, a parasite with a random letter will appear at the centre of the window, indicating that this letter is the only one that is suitable for its "food". To coexist with it, you need to simply select the corresponding letter on the website (regardless of case) and copy it to your clipboard, which is constantly being read by the parasite. If the letters are correct and you are selecting the same letters over and over again, the parasite will grow bigger, the opacity of its color will decrease and eventually it will outgrow the size of the page and also become completely transparent. At this point you are free to navigate your page as you normally do. However, if you keep selecting the wrong letters, the parasite will still get bigger, but its color will become more and more opaque, eventually covering your entire page and making it completely impossible to read anything. If you choose to leave it alone, it will move around the page on its own, looking for its "food". When it finds a "food" letter, it stays on the "food" letter for a while and then eats it. Your page will therefore be missing a letter. It will keep looking for the "food" it needs until it has eaten all the food it can on your page.
