## Friends or Enemies?

When referring to parasites, some people may instinctively assume that they are only bad for their hosts and try to eliminate them. But in fact, some parasites can live in symbiosis with their hosts. So I come up with the idea of letting the characteristics of parasites change according to the way we treat them. The user can decide whether to become friends or enemies with them.

This parasite feeds on the letters on the page. When you open any website, a parasite with a random letter will appear at the centre of the window, indicating that this letter is the only one that is suitable for its "food". To coexist with it, you need to simply select the corresponding letter on the website (regardless of case) and copy it to your clipboard, which is constantly being read by the parasite. If the letters are correct and you are selecting the same letters over and over again, the parasite will grow bigger, the opacity of its color will decrease and eventually it will outgrow the size of the page and also become completely transparent. At this point you are free to navigate your page as you normally do. However, if you keep selecting the wrong letters, the parasite will still get bigger, but its color will become more and more opaque, eventually covering your entire page and making it completely impossible to read anything. If you choose to leave it alone, it will move around the page on its own, looking for its "food". When it finds a "food" letter, it stays on the "food" letter for a while and then eats it. Your page will therefore be missing a letter. It will keep looking for the "food" it needs until it has eaten all the food it can on your page.

The message I want to convey is that the words on these pages are not just letters, phrases and sentences that are lifeless, but they are used by people to convey information, sometimes to inform people of news, sometimes to give them strength and motivation. Words are therefore not just words, they are alive and meaningful. For my project, words are the medium through which we can have a symbiosis with the parasite. In coexisting with the parasite, we should learn to value the meaning of these words and realize that if only one letter/word is wrong, the meaning it expresses/the effect it presents will be different. Particularly with some news stories, journalists sometimes distort the facts to attract attention. The incorrect information he conveys by changing words may have a negative impact on the event/person he is reporting on. In the case of my project, if you feed the wrong 'food' to your parasites, you will be caught in a vicious circle and will be retributed in the end.
