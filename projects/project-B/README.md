## Description
The theme of this project is an extension that allows you to keep a pet on your browser. This cute little pet is a parasite that lives on your browser and feeds by ingesting text on web pages. By pressing the button *"where's my cutie pet"* in the pop-up window, the parasite will appear on your page. You can feed it by selecting the text. When you select the text, the parasite will run to the location you selected and eat the text, which will disappear from your page and then reappear after a while. The more the parasite eats, the larger it will get and the more transparent its color will become. In the end, after it has eaten a certain amount of text, it will disappear from your page. You can make it appear by pressing the button in the pop-up window again. If you are halfway through feeding it and don't want to see it anymore, you can press another button *"bye bye my cutie pet"* to make it disappear.

## Challenges
Although this extension is now in a working state, I haven't fully realized my initial idea. What I'd like to do is when I'm not feeding the parasite, it will run around the page on its own and randomly eat the text on the page. At this time the eaten text will no longer be reappeared. Also, the parasite would not only move freely around the page, but it would also run to the page's title. However, due to time constraints, I did not complete these ideas.

## Future Steps
In yesterday's presentation, I received a lot of inspiration from feedback of classmates, professor, as well as our guest speaker. Chino suggested that I could make the parasite more like a real pet.If I don't feed it, it will eat the text on the web page and grow bigger and bigger, gradually start to block my view of the web page without changing the transparency. When I feed it, it will return to its original size. Sometimes it can also bring me random text from other pages, which adds to the fun of this extension. I think all these suggestions are very valuable and useful. I also hope to implement them in the future if I have the chance.
